# Node.js simple webserver

A web server I created in node.js.

This is one of my first node.js applications so please give me tips and things that can be improved.

## Usage

Running the run.bat file will simply create a webserver on port 80, with the path for the files in /siteFiles. If you go in the directory this will try to acces a index.html or index.htm file in that order.
